# Professional profile

Agricultural economist specializing in ex-ante impact assessment of agricultural research for development (AR4D) policies and projects, with an emphasis on climate change adaptation strategies. My current work focuses on applications of financial risk assessment, real options evaluation, and portfolio optimization techniques in the context of AR4D, smallholder farming, and climate change. I am familiar with post-conflict environments, having edited a book and produced a BBC documentary on the lives of ex-combatants in Colombia. I am proficient in machine learning (R caret package), and trained in sector and general equilibrium modeling (IMPACT, GTAP), as well as more parsimonious modeling (Economic Surplus Model, TOA-MD). I am a proficient programmer in Stata, Matlab, R, and Visual Basic. Can also manage SAS, SPSS, GAMS, python, and GIS applications if need be. I am an excellent written and spoken communicator in English and Spanish. I have won two Innocentive awards.

# Work experience

tribble(
  ~ what, ~ when, ~ with, ~ why,
  "Research Associate", "2016-11 to Present", "International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)", 'As part of the Decision and Policy Analysis (DAPA) team, my overarching duty is to research and develop proactive, innovative perspectives on the risk environment of smallholder farm communities in the developing world, especially as regards emerging threats posed by climate change and price volatility. The guiding aim is to identify areas of latent risk/social capital that have been overlooked by mainstream development narratives, and to develop methodology for the evaluation and operationalization of these "hidden" resources. A major part of this work consists of conducting ex-ante impact assessments of climate change shocks in conjunction with the release of new agricultural research products, using established models such as IMPACT, but also new techniques that I am actively developing.',
  "Consultant", "2014-11 to 2016-08", "International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)", "Over the course of four consultancies (each one lasting about 3 months), I worked with the DAPA team on the following deliverables: 1) A decision support framework for the ex-ante evaluation of research projects under risk, and for optimal fund allocation across portfolios containing several such projects; 2)  An ex-ante adoption rate simulation model for the evaluation of climate change mitigation strategies; and 3) An ex-ante impact assessment of improved, climate-friendly forage varieties in East Africa.",
  "Consultant", "2013-06 to 2014-02", "International Potato Center (CIP)", "This was a short term consultancy to assess the costs to a non-profit institution of developing a transgenic crop program oriented towards resource-poor farmers, for approval and release in one developing country. The non-profit institutions participating in this study were CIP (Nairobi office), Wageningen University in the Netherlands, and Cornell University in New York. The final draft of my report has been published in the International Journal of Biotechnology.",
  "Research Assistant", "2012-02 to 2013-09", "Oregon State University", "Working within the framework of the Agricultural Model Improvement and Intercomparison Project (AgMIP), I completed a study on resource-poor farmer adaptation to climate change in Kenya.  This entailed a deep analysis of a panel of farm returns data in conjunction with future climate data generated by Global Circulation Models, down-scaled to 10 arcminute resolution.",
  "Volunteer work with ex-combatants", "2006-04 to 2009-11", "Informal", 'In Bogota, I participated in various activities supporting the transition from warfare to civilian livelihood for recently demobilized ex-combatants. These efforts resulted in a published book and BBC documentary called "Peace Woods". The documentary aired worldwide in October 2007. The book was titled "Cuando la Guerra es el Unico Camino" by Juan Carlos Vargas Sachik, published in 2007 by Norma in Bogota. During this unstructured phase, I also worked as an English teacher and translator.',
  "Consultant", "2005-02 to 2006-04", "Tetra Tech Inc.", "In Bogota, I conducted interviews of key actors in the Colombian forestry sector, in support of Tetra Tech's USAID ADAM and MIDAS Program proposal writing efforts. Tetra Tech ended up winning both bids, after which I continued on as an assistant to the MIDAS Forestry Component Manager during the start-up phase.",
  "Junior Consultant", "2001-06 to 2001-10", "Chemonics Inc.", "Conducted a brief study of the impact of trade rules of origin on Southern African Development Community trade flows."
